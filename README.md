# GB_Emulator

## Abstract
The GameBoy is an 8-bit handheld game console from 1989. Although the console and games are no longer in production or being sold commerically the system can be kept alive through emulation. This project aims to create an accurate emulation properly synchronizing cycle timings to allow for the old games (.gb) to be played.
