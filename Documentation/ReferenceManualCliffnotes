Has two processing states:
- flips between the states
- all exception handling is performed in the ARM

if exception in thumb then below occurs:
thumb -> arm -> thumb


Memory formats:

little-endian
lowest addressed byte in the word is lsb

    31--24          23--16       15--8        7--0
|                        word at A                  |
|               hw at A+2    |            hw at A   |
|    byt A+3    |  byt A+2   |  bytm A+1    | byt A |

big-endian
